FOOTNOTES

MET LIG

08  01  Value for c110 is an estimate based on Mt79; all others from Li79.

20  02  Values for complexes are from No89, but reports have varied widely. Solid 11-1 is jurbanite, from No82.

01  09  Solid 11 1 is brushite(DCPD); solid 43 1 is octacalcium phosphate; solid 32 0 is beta-Ca3(PO4)2 (c).

02  09  Solid 32 0 is bobierrite; solid 11 1 is newberryite; all values from Li79.

06  09  Solids are 'FePO4 (c)' and strengite, respectively.

08  09  Solid 11 1 is MnHPO4 (c); solid 32 0 is Mn3(PO4)2 (c); solid 54 2 is Mn5H2(PO4)4*4H2O; 

12  09  Value for c110 is an estimate based on Mt79.

20  09  Values for complexes are estimates only, from No89, and should not be considered reliable.  Solid 
        110a is berlinite; solid 110b is variscite, both from Li79.

07  17  Some values determined at 37 C.

20  17  Reported values for Al-CIT are highly variable, those of Mo84 selected for compatabilty with compilations
        of Martell and Smith.

00  68  All values for EDDHA are suspect; they were determined using commercial EDDHA which is a mixture of two isomers with
        rather different metal-binding properties.  Bannochie and Martell (1989, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 111:4735) have determined 
        some log K's for the individual isomers, but lack of values for Ca and Mg limit their utility, even if the isomers were 
        separated.  EDDHA is thus not currently recommended for precise control or estimation of free metal activities.

07  68  Metal ion is oxidized slowly and ligand is reduced.

06  77  Complex 120 should be viewed with suspicion; possible error in reported ionic strength.

06  99  The only solid included is amorphous Fe(OH)3; it is likely an overestimate of Fe(III) solubility.  Other phases often
        included are "soil Fe(OH)3" & goethite (see Li79).

09  99  Solids are tenorite, and 'soil-Cu' as per Li79.

12  99  Values for hydrolysis are variable -- Sm76 gives -9.0 for c10-1.  Solids: s10-2a = amorphous, s10-2b = zincite.

20  99  Solid is synthetic gibbsite (Ma79); complexes are from No89.  More soluble solids (e.g., amorphous Al(OH)3, log K = -9.7 
        [Li79]) are often reported, but likely reflect nonequilibrium and/or failure to quantify mononuclear Al.  See discussion 
        in Kinraide and Parker (1989, Plant, Cell Environ. 12:479-487).

32  99  Solid 10-2a is gummite; solid 10-2b is gamma-UO3; solid 10-2c is schoepite; all from La78.

38  99  All hydrolysis constants except 10-1 are considered estimates (La78).  Solid 10-4a is UO2 (amorphous); solid 10-4b is
        uranite; solid 30-8 is alpha-U3O8 (c); all from La78.
