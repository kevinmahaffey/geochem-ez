<p class="style4">The &quot;Edit&quot; menu bar allows the user to build and edit the salts database. Tailor the database to your needs, adding salts that are used frequently and removing those that are not. </p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style6">Salts Database</span>- <span class="style4">a file (Geodat-A.salts)  which contains information on salts commonly used to make nutrient solutions. The database is constructed so that each row describes a particular salt and parses it into its constituent metal and ligand parts. Included in this descriptor row are the molecular weight of the salt, the metal and ligand codes (see &quot;<a href="../Metal Ligand Database/Metal Ligand Database.html" tabindex="11" title="metal / ligand database" accesskey="M" target="_blank">metal / ligand database</a>&quot;), and the stoichiometries of the metals and ligands in that salt. Salts may be added to the database using the &quot;Create a New Salt&quot; function. </span></p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style6">Create A New Salt</span>- allows the user to add  to the Salts database, as long as the metals and ligands that make up the salt are in the<a href="../Metal Ligand Database/Metal Ligand Database.html" tabindex="11" title="metal / ligand database" accesskey="M" target="_blank"> metal / ligand database</a>. Click on &quot;Create a New Salt&quot; and the &quot;Salt Creator&quot; dialog box opens. The user can name the salt and then enter the formula manually, using the &quot;Generate&quot; button to parse the compound. Alternatively, using the drop down menu one can select the metals and ligands and enter the amount of the particular ion. For example, in creating the salt Na2HPO4 one could use the drop down menu to select Na+ and enter 2 as the amount, since for every mole of Na2HPO4 there are two mole equivalents of Na+. After that H+ would be entered on the next line, with one as the amount. The same goes for PO4-. When all of the components of the salt have been added, then click on &quot;Save&quot; at the bottom of the &quot;Salt Creator&quot; dialog box and this formulation will be added to the Salts database. </p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style6">Edit Salts Database</span>- use this feature to remove or to modify the information about a salt presently in the Salts database. </p>
